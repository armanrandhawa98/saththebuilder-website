5. **Mark featured projects** - highlight your best work on homepage

### For Efficiency:

2. **Open multiple tabs** - Instagram, admin tool, gallery for checking
3. **Process in batches** - don't try to do everything at once
4. **Save frequently** - don't lose your work

## üîß Technical Details

### Image Handling
- Images are referenced by URL (not downloaded)
- Instagram URLs may expire over time
- Consider uploading important images to Cloudinary for permanence

### Data Processing
- Captions are cleaned (remove hashtags, format text)
- Tags are extracted from hashtags and caption content
- Titles are suggested from first line of caption
- Descriptions remove excessive formatting

### Error Handling
- Invalid URLs are caught
- Missing data gets default values
- Import errors are reported individually
- Partial imports are supported

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Instagram Terms**: Only migrate your own content
2. **Image Rights**: Ensure you have rights to all images
3. **URL Expiration**: Instagram image URLs may change
4. **Rate Limits**: Don't import too quickly (Instagram may block)
5. **Backup**: Keep original Instagram posts as backup

## üé® After Migration

1. **Review Gallery** - Check how projects look on your site
2. **Edit Projects** - Use admin panel to refine details
3. **Set Featured** - Mark 3-5 best projects as featured
4. **Test Mobile** - Ensure images look good on all devices
5. **Update SEO** - Add proper descriptions for search engines

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Images not loading**: Instagram URL expired, try re-copying
- **Import fails**: Check CSV format, ensure all required columns
- **Console script errors**: Refresh Instagram page, try again
- **Missing projects**: Check if "Published" is enabled

### Getting Help:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify admin permissions are working
3. Test with single project first
4. Check network connection for image URLs
